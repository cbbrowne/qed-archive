# QED For Unix - 1992

# Introduction

The files in this directory are from a tarball sent to me by Rob Pike
(r AT golang.org),
one of the original developers of QED at the University of Toronto.
The files are dated September 7, 1992.  I chose not to try to layer
them on top of the files I have from 1985, but simply to present
them as I received them.

Of note is that there is more documentation here than in my tarball.
