CIT:
- many bugs fixed; e.g. startup code doesn't work if nfiles>25
- added \5 in RE's (making them IRREGULAR!) -- see V7 ed docn
BELL:
- l mode changed so tab is \(tab), \n appears after space or tab
  - this will change back; i don't like it (it's slightly ambiguous
    if spaces follow tabs on a line)
- cd command gone away
- , now defaults to 1 on LHS, $ on RHS; * address operator gone away
- /etc/qedfile concept gone; it is now a env. var QEDFILE
- oB is old ob
- ob67P sets page size to 67 lines in P format
- changed b command so that b40 means page is 40 lines not 41
- change (c) doesn't delete until after '.' is typed (so you can DEL)
- added <...|...|...> to regular expressions
	| chooses alternate RE's  <x|y> matches x or y
	<> can be *'d or +'d
- zae now gets one char code of last err; null string if none so far.
- zap prints in p mode; zal in l mode; zan sets count to length of reg.
- za#n sets count to length of .
- za#? gone; za#P gets pid
- ok command gone
- ha gone. the rule for until now is:
	h[N][tf ]
	t==> until true; f==> until false; blank ==> forever
	if number is present, it's like an OR
- xform demands you have dualcase. if not, you get an error (t)
- V6 support completely gone (sorry. well, not really)
- W is now an appended write. cflag still gotten right!
- can write empty file if address is explicit.
- za{VAR} puts environment variable in za
- | is the long-awaited in-code replacement for \zrun
- zas/x/y/  substitutes y for x in za. real substitute!
- -e flag: exit on error (for pipelining)
- trailing delimiters in sub's etc. cause auto print
- nflag taken away; x is automatically xp
- ?q, Q and E like in ed
- b.
- on startup, gives 'f' line instead of char count
- zU gets last command line typed to unix, !! >> << || replace second char by
  \'zU
