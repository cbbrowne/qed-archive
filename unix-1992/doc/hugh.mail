The description of Quantification and Alternation in regular expressions
might read:

6.  A regular expression of the form <x1> or <x1|x2|...|xn>, where the
x's are regular expressions of forms 1-12, matches what the
leftmost successful x matches.  The nesting of \( and \) (see rule 11)
must be identical in each x.

Rule 8 must be augmented:

The regular expression must not contain \( or \) (see rule 11).

In place of this addition to rule 8 and the last sentence of the
proposed rule 6, you could add to rule 11:

The nesting of these brackets in each regular expression of an alternation
(rule 6) must be identical.  An alternation with these brackets may
not be iterated (rule 8).

This formulation requires fewer forward references, and talks about
\( and \) only one place.  It seems somewhat awkward in that it
gives names to the constructs of rules 6 and 8.

I recommend you listen to Talking Heads' latest, "Remain in the Light".
I at first found it interesting and then later I grew to like it.

1. If you have the time and patience at 300 baud, type:
   "cd /u2/hugh/bin
    huf -p mr.nrH | nroff pre.nr -"
   It is an 8 page document partially addressing the problem
   I think you raised with allocreg.  You might save yourself
   some time if you made a copy of pre.nr and changed the ".po".
2. Do you know why the modify date on my qed is so recent?
   Is my copy older than the system's now?  If so, I will delete it.
   (It must be different because the lengths are different (but only a
   little).)

Groan. I didn't recompile it, just installed from the tape bin/qed.v6.

Now I have to recompile etc.
