# QED For The SDS 940

## Introduction

These files were supplied to me by Lars Brinkhoff (lars AT nocrew.org).
I have no idea where he got them.

## Contents

The two `.txt` files are the source for the editor itself, in
assembly language.

There are two different reference manuals, one fron 1968, and one
from 1969, describing QED.
