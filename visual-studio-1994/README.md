# QED - Visual Studio

## Introduction

I got these files from Don Mitchell.
They are a port of Rob Pike's QED to compile on Windows with
Visual Studio.
Don writes:

	Rob's tar file is probably what you want.   Here's the windows
	version, which is some version of QED with an extra file that
	crudely simulates the UNIX sbrk call.

The original zip file has various object files and files that Visual Studio
creates which I have removed from the directory. I am including the
zip file in case they may be of interest.
