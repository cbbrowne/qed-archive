# QED For Unix - 1985

# Introduction

The files in this directory are from a tarball
I received in 1987.  The file is dated October 30, 1987 in my filesystem,
but the files themselves date from 1985.

I no longer remember who gave it to me.  I also have to admit
that I never actually used QED; I think I read the manual page and
decided that it was too complicated for me. :-)

Having skimmed the code, it would take work to bring it up to date
for modern systems. I think that
[Leah Neukirchen's version](https://github.com/chneukirchen/qed-caltech)
would be better than trying to use this old code.
I am providing it mainly out of historical interest.
